# Script: Understanding Comparison Operators in Python

# Explanation: Comparison Operators
# Comparison operators compare values and return boolean results.

# Example 1: Greater Than
x = 5
y = 10
greater_than_result = x > y
print("Greater Than:", greater_than_result)

# Example 2: Less Than
less_than_result = x < y
print("Less Than:", less_than_result)

# Example 3: Equal To
equal_to_result = x == y
print("Equal To:", equal_to_result)

# Example 4: Not Equal To
not_equal_to_result = x != y
print("Not Equal To:", not_equal_to_result)

# Example 5: Greater Than or Equal To
greater_than_equal_result = x >= y
print("Greater Than or Equal To:", greater_than_equal_result)

# Example 6: Less Than or Equal To
less_than_equal_result = x <= y
print("Less Than or Equal To:", less_than_equal_result)

# OUTPUT

# Greater Than: False
# Less Than: True
# Equal To: False
# Not Equal To: True
# Greater Than or Equal To: False
# Less Than or Equal To: True
